        "\n",
        "- **User U001** focused on **Supervised Learning** with a specific emphasis on **Linear Regression** and **Classification**:\n",
        "  - On January 19, U001 reviewed the fundamentals of linear regression, covering the cost functions and gradient descent.\n",
        "  - On January 20, U001 explored logistic regression and applied it to a dataset predicting student outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **User U002** concentrated on **Feature Engineering** and **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
        "  - On January 19, U002 began working on encoding techniques for categorical features, including both label encoding and one-hot encoding.\n",
        "  - On January 21, U002 learned about regression evaluation metrics, specifically R-squared and RMSE, and compared the performance of different regression techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Areas for Improvement\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Documentation and Sharing**: Users could enhance their learning by documenting their findings and sharing them with peers or through a collaborative platform. This would help in peer review and deeper discussion.\n",
